# BCI-Wheelchair
A collection of scripts, scenarios, and config files relating to the BCI Wheelchair project

## Todo:
* Update serial controller code to use accelerometer information
  - Acceleration Detection for moving periods.
  - Karman Filtering for accurate positional data collection.
* Improve turning function to make better use of magnetometer
  - Rewrite adafruit libraries to make better use of magnetometer registers and interrupts.
* Analog Wheelchair Controller
  - I give up for now.
